The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming the way we interact with technology. Every physical object, from a tiny temperature sensor to a massive industrial robot, can be connected to the internet and made intelligent through data collection and processing. What makes IoT powerful is not just the connectivity, but the continuous flow of information that helps systems make real-time decisions.

IoT systems typically involve four major layers: the hardware layer, the connectivity layer, the edge computing layer, and the cloud platform. The hardware layer includes microcontrollers like ESP32, Arduino, and STM32 that interact with sensors and actuators. These devices collect data such as temperature, humidity, motion, GPS location, or even vibration levels in industrial machines.

The connectivity layer ensures that the collected data reaches the next stage. Devices can communicate using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, LoRaWAN, Zigbee, NB-IoT, or cellular connections like 4G and 5G. Each protocol has its own advantages. For example, Wi-Fi provides higher bandwidth, while LoRaWAN offers long-range communication with very low power consumption.

In the edge computing layer, data is processed close to the device. Instead of sending every bit of information to the cloud, some logic is applied directly on the microcontroller or a nearby device like a Raspberry Pi. This reduces latency, enhances security, and saves network bandwidth. Edge computing is especially useful in applications like autonomous vehicles, smart factories, and remote monitoring systems.

Finally, the cloud platform handles large-scale data storage, analytics, visualization, and automation. Platforms like AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub, and Google Cloud IoT provide tools to manage millions of devices efficiently. They help developers build dashboards, automate workflows, send alerts, and run machine learning models that can predict equipment failures before they happen.

The beauty of IoT lies in its endless possibilities. From smart homes that automatically adjust lights and temperature, to massive industrial plants that optimize energy usage, IoT is shaping the future of technology. As more devices become connected, the demand for skilled IoT engineers continues to grow. Learning embedded programming, C/C++, Python, networking protocols, and cloud integration opens the door to exciting opportunities in this fast-evolving field.

This text is long enough to test Node.js readable streams. When you load this file using fs.createReadStream, Node will split the content into chunks and trigger the 'data' event multiple times. This allows you to observe how streaming works with large content, especially when the file size crosses the default internal buffer limit. Whether you're reading logs, processing files, or streaming live data, understanding Node's streaming mechanism is extremely important for backend and IoT applications.
